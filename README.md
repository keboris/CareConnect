📌 Project Overview
CareConnect is a multilingual community platform that connects individuals to offer or request support with everyday tasks.
This project was conceived and implemented entirely independently—ranging from the initial system architecture and backend logic to the final deployment. 
The primary objective was to develop a scalable, modern web application featuring a clear role-based structure and the capacity for international expansion.
